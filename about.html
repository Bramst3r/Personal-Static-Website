                    His history in music starts around the age of 10, where he attended drum classes for 4 years.
                    Drums where fun, but he quickly realised that his love for EDM was bigger then his love for drums.
                    That's why he picked up FL Studio 11 and made his first productions inspired by the sounds of Avicii, Hardwell, Armin van buuren, Deadmau5 and the likes.

                    Not long after he made a handfull of proudctions, he got accapted for a 3-year Music Production study at the 
                    <a class="link" target="_blank" href="https://www.rocva.nl" style="font-size: large;">  ROC of Amsterdam</a>.
                    Here he learnd a lot about the basics and had the time to develop his workflow and style.
                    With these skills, he now wanted the focus more on the technical part of sound in general and music theory. 
                    That's why a bachelor in MediaMusic at 
                    <a class="link" target="_blank" href="https://www.artez.nl/en/" style="font-size: large;">  ArtEZ</a> 
                    Enschede was where his next 4 years unfolted.
                    <br>
                    After these 2 studies, Bram is exploring different opporunities and is trying to exand his network.
                    Whather if it's an album for a band or music for a video game, he loves to implement his style in all sorts of projects.
