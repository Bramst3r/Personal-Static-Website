                    Hey there! My name is Bram (b. 1998) and I'm a Dutch music producer with a rich background in Electronic Dance Music. 
                    I've made songs for different artists and media productions.
                    My notable work comes from a partnership with 
                    <a class="link" target="_blank" href="https://bmgproductionmusic.com/en-nl" style="font-size: large;">  BMG Production Music</a>. 
                    Through this collaboration, my music can be heard on TV and streaming services all over the world. 
                    <br>
                    I also work together with different artists across Europe. 
                    On writing camps I get the chance to combine my experience with others to create something completely unique.
                    It's important to keep looking for ways to improve and learn from other people. 
                    That's why I also love to experiment with audio production for games or sample packs.
                    <br>
                    TLDR: I love to create electronic music for all sorts of purposes!

                    My history in music starts around the age of 10, where I attended drum classes for 4 years.
                    Drums where fun, but I quickly realised that my love for EDM was bigger.
                    That's when I made my first productions inspired by the sounds of Avicii, Hardwell, Armin van buuren, Deadmau5 and the likes.
                    <br>
                    Not long after that, I got accepted for a 3-year-study in Music Production at the 
                    <a class="link" target="_blank" href="https://www.rocva.nl" style="font-size: large;">  ROC of Amsterdam</a>.
                    That place taught me a lot about the basics and it made me develop my own workflow and style.
                    With that new found knowledge, I wanted to focus more on the technical side of audio and music theory. 
                    That's why a bachelor in MediaMusic at 
                    <a class="link" target="_blank" href="https://www.artez.nl/en/" style="font-size: large;">  ArtEZ</a> 
                    Enschede was my next adventure.
                    <br>
                    After these 2 studies, I'm exploring different opporunities and expanding my network.
                    Whether if it's an album for a band or music for a video game, I love to implement my style in all sorts of projects!
